## Notice
This script only contains Japanese words, phrases, and Kanji, that I've learned and/or
understand. If you're more advanced I'd recommend trying something else. The purpose of
this script is to help me memorize Japanese words, phrases, and Kanji.

Please also note that this script/quiz is still in development and not all quizzes are available!

## Description
As stated above, this script will provide you with a quiz based on the quiz type you choose
(as seen below).

| Quiz Type         | Description |
| ---               | ---         |
| `Hiragana (ひらがな)`	      | Quizzes a user on Hiragana characters. |
| `Katakana (カタカナ)`        | Quizzes a user on Katakana characters. |
| `Kanji (漢字)`           | Quizzes a user on Kanji characters. |
| `Hard Vocab`      | Quizzes a user on vocab I taught myself and from other sources. |
| `Phrases`         | Quizzes on phrases/sayings. |
| `Vocab (MLJP201)` | Quizzes on Chapter Vocab from MLJP201 at RIT.  |

## Installation
Make sure you have GIT installed on the system!
```
git clone https://github.com/parkerswierzewski/Japanese-Quiz.git
cd Japanese-Quiz
python3 japanese_quiz.py
```
You're good to go :)
Make sure whatever terminal you're using is able to print Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji!
Although a Japanese keyboard isn't required, it is strongly recommended!

## Set Up
If you're having trouble seeing Japanese Hiragana, Katakana, and/or Kanji characters,
I find that the *MS Mincho* font works the best.

**Windows 10**
1. Open up the terminal.
2. Right-click the top of the terminal.
3. Click on "Properties"
4. Click on "Fonts" and then scroll through the fonts until you find MS Mincho (it's near the bottom).
5. Click "Ok" and you should now be able to see Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji characters!

**Mac OS**
You should have no problem viewing characters.
