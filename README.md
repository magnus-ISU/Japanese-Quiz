## Notice
This script only contains Japanese words, phrases, and Kanji, that I've learned and/or
understand. If you're more advanced I'd recommend trying something else. The purpose of
this script is to help me memorize Japanese words, phrases, and Kanji.

Please also note that this script/quiz is still in development and not all quizzes are available!

## Description
As stated above, this script will provide you with a quiz based on the quiz type you choose
(as seen below).

| Quiz Type         | Description |
| ---               | ---         |
| `Hiragana (ひらがな)`	      | Quizzes a user on Hiragana characters. |
| `Katakana (カタカナ)`        | Quizzes a user on Katakana characters. |
| `Kanji (漢字)`           | Quizzes a user on Kanji characters. |
| `Hard Vocab`      | Quizzes a user on vocab I taught myself and from other sources. |
| `Phrases`         | Quizzes on phrases/sayings. |
| `Vocab (MLJP201)` | Quizzes on Chapter Vocab from MLJP201 at RIT.  |

## Installation
Make sure you have GIT installed on the system!
```
git clone https://github.com/parkerswierzewski/Japanese-Quiz.git
python3 japanese_quiz.py
```
You're good to go :)
Make sure whatever terminal you're using is able to print Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji!
Although a Japanese keyboard isn't required, it is strongly recommended!
